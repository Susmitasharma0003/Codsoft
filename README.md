This repository contains three projects completed during my CodSoft Internship: Titanic Survival Prediction, Movie Rating Prediction, and Iris Flower Classification. The projects include data preprocessing, visualization, and model building using Logistic Regression and Regression techniques. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and other evaluation measures.
